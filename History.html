            <h1>History of Dinagyang</h1>
            <p>The Dinagyang Festival is an annual cultural and religious festival held in Iloilo City, Philippines. It is celebrated in honor of the Santo Niño (Child Jesus) and the native Ati tribe.<b>
           The festival traces its roots back to 1967, and over the years it has grown into one of the most famous festivals in the country, attracting tourists from around the world.<b>
            Dinagyang, initially known as Iloilo Ati-Atihan, began after Rev.Fr. Ambrosio Galindez, the first Filipino Rector of the Augustinian Community and Parish Priest of the San Jose Parish<b>
                introduced the devotion to Santo Niño in November 1967 after observing the Ati-Atihan Festival in the province of Aklan. </p>
